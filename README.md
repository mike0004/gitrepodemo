gitrepodemo
===========
This project is to help getting familiar with git nuances without fear of corrupting a shared repository.

To run:

$./reset-repos.sh

This will create a new local repository and two working dirs. Each of the working dirs represents a different user, wd1 and wd2.

After you have initialized the repos, go into wd1 and wd2 and make changes, commit code, push and pull and see how the commits work via the 
various git status commands.
